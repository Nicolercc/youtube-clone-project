          One of the key features of Streamify is the ability to filter videos
          based on categories. We understand that each user has their own unique
          preferences, and with our category filtering feature, you can easily
          explore videos specific to your interests.

          Additionally, we encourage user engagement and interaction through our
          comments feature. We believe that watching videos should be a social
          experience, and therefore, we provide a platform for users to leave
          comments and engage in discussions with fellow viewers. Share your
          thoughts, ask questions, and connect with others who share your
          passion for the videos you love.
